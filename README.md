# TestingGeneratedNumbersProject
This application generates a random number within three types of store capacity: 
128-bit , 64-bit, 32-bit store capacities.
Currently, application uses two approaches to generate number: a Uniform distribution and a Triangular Distribution.
After generating number, the program will also print the computational cost (time which was consumed to generate number).
